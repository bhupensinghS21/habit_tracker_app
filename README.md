# habit_tracker_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. In this project, I have integrated several dependencies to enhance the functionality, including charts, shared preferences, image picker, and more. The application allows users to add habits they want to follow and track their progress on a calendar by simply tapping on the relevant dates. Users can also change the language and toggle dark mode in the settings, making the app easier to use at night. Additionally, the app includes a graph or chart view to help users monitor their daily activities.

Future enhancements:

Implement Firebase sign-in and login functionality.
Integrate cloud storage to securely save users' habits and track their weekly progress.
